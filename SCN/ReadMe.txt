How to make it work:

1. Create a separate directory and download SCN_release_v1_py.zip from http://deepscn.com/software.php.

2. Extract SCN_release_v1.zip to obtain the following 4 files: 
   * SCN.py  (Main file for building SCN models)
   * Demo_Regression.py
   * Demo_Classification.py
   Make sure the file names have not been changed.

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

4. For the toy experiments, run Demo_Regression.m and Demo_Classification.m in Python3.5+

5. For your own applications, make sure you have enough RAM and Disk to support the computation on your computing device.

6. The demos can be modified with new datasets. You can also change the parameters and the configurations for the SCN model in the code.
